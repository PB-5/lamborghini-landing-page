# Rent a Car - Landing Page 
This was part of an assessment at the end of learning HTML & CSS. There were a lot and I mean a lot of debugging my css and div tags heh. Used a lot of documentation and few tutorials. I got kind of obsessed to make it neat and appealing, lost a lot of sleep but worth in my opinion. 

Took me about 10 days of head scratching but I am happy with it for the most part although some parts like the carousel not being automatic because I don't knnow JavaScript yet. But we will work on that. There are a few things beyond me but I will get there ;)
